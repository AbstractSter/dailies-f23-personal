      <h2 class="font-serif text-xl lg:text-2xl my-2 lg:my-4">Subheading</h2>
        <p>The 2023 New Zealand general election was held on 14 October 2023 to determine the composition of the 54th Parliament of New Zealand. Voters elected 120 members to the unicameral New Zealand House of Representatives under the mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting system, with 71 members elected from single-member electorates and 49 members elected from closed party lists.[1] There were 72 electorates, and the remaining electorate MP will be determined in the 2023 Port Waikato by-election; the electorate MP election for Port Waikato has been cancelled due to the death of one of the candidates. As one additional overhang seat was won on election day, there will be 122 members of parliament once the by-election has been held.[2]

        <p>The incumbent centre-left Labour Party, led by Chris Hipkins, sought to win a third term for the Sixth Labour Government. However, on preliminary results, they were defeated in a landslide, with the centre-right National Party, led by Christopher Luxon, becoming the largest party in the new parliament.[3] The election saw the worst defeat of a sitting government in New Zealand since the introduction of the MMP voting system in 1996, with Labour going from having 65 seats in the first-ever majority government under MMP to winning just 34 seats. Labour faced a 17-point swing against it, whilst National improved its party vote share by 11 percentage points. The Green and ACT parties and Te PƒÅti Maori all increased their vote share, while New Zealand First gained enough votes to return to parliament after being ousted in the 2020 election.</p>
